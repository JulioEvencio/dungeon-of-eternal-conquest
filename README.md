# Dungeon of Eternal Conquest

An action-adventure game where the objective is to descend as deep as possible into the dungeon. Currently, there are only 10 levels.

## How to run

This project is just a simple `Java` project, so compile it normally using a `JDK` (I recommend `OpenJDK 17`). The main class that contains the `main method` is `game.main.Game`
